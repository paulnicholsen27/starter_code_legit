Good job on the pairing today!! Today's lecture notes and videos are up on Learn (ask me or a coach if you're not sure how to access them).  A bunch more labs have been deployed... probably too many for anyone to do in one night.  To prioritize:

1. Catch up on the _Object Orientation_ labs, so everything up to today's pairing. Skip Bonus labs unless you're feeling good about the material and want a challenge.  "Advanced Class Methods Lab" isn't listed as a *BONUS* as it's _very_ useful to do, but not critical for understanding all the stuff that follows, so skip it if you're slammed.

2. Do the first four labs in _Object Relationships_ (Intro To Object Relationships, Belongs To Object Lab, Has Many Object, Has Many Object Lab)

It's OK if you're totally confused about Object Orientation!  This is difficult material that we're going through _very_ quickly and you are not alone!  Do your best, start a list of questions or concepts that you're still confused about.  Drop into a pry and make sure all the variables (including `self`!) are what you expect them to be.  Keep at it!
