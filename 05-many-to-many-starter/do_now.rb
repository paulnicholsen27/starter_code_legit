# Build out these classes and methods so that a restaurant can track the meals it serves, 
# and a Meal knows all the restaurants where it is served.  e.g., if McDonalds and Burger King
# both serve hamburgers and chicken sandwiches, `mcdonalds.meals` would include both hamburgers
# and chicken sandwiches, and `hamburger.restaurants` would include both McDonalds and Burger King
