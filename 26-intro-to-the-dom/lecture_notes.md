Re-emphasize:
    - Because JS is so flexible, you have to learn what's working on, not just the patterns
    - Make no assumptions--verify everything in a console.log or a debugger

Open `index.html` in terminal.  Review different ways to open (`open .`, "Open in Browser" from Sublime).  Good time to point out how URLs find resources in a file path vs a web addressfasdf
