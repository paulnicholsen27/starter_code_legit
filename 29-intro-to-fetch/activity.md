## Practice

- Going to https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon in your browser shows information about 20 pokemon in a Javascript object
- Make a fetch call to that URL.  This will return a promise
- Use the data in that promise to list the names of the pokemon in your console.
- Bonus: Render the names of those pokemon in an unordered list
