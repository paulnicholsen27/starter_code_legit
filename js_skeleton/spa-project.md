# Fun With Single Page Applications

Your task for today is to build a Single-Page-Application of your choosing with your partner(s).  You're starting totally from scratch--a good place to start is with an index.html and a script.js file.


Notes:

- Use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and a self-created `.json` file for your backend.  JSON rules are very strict: You may want to use a [validator](https://jsonlint.com/) if you're having trouble.
- Remember:  **{When this event happens} I want to make {this type of fetch call} and manipulate the DOM {in this way}**
- Be creative, but make sure you're at least hitting a few of the CRUD actions so you're confident in how to make them work.
- Don't spend too much time making it look nice with CSS.  That's not the focus today!  (If you _do_ have some simple CSS, think about how to use JavaScript to affect it!)
- Challenge yourselves!  And ask for help when you need it!
- Projects will be shared at 5:30!
